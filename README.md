# CalculatorUI - JavaFX application

## Building the project

To build the project type `mvn package` in command prompt where `pom.xml` is located.

If you have no interest in building the application then you can [download it](https://github.com/Jollerr/CalculatorUI/raw/master/CalculatorUI.jar). You must have the Java Runtime Environment version 8 or above.


### Explanation 
This application was meant to replace Excel while solving my diploma work.<br>I hated hidden formulas (also unreadable) in Excel when doing calculations and then typing them into a Word file afterwards.
